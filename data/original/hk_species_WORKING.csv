It is also susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on agricultural land (Kwon et al. 2004). Populations in Greenland are threatened by human disturbance at moulting sites from tourists in cruise liners (once displaced from a site birds are unlikely to find unoccupied replacement sites) (Glahder and Walsh 2006), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the vius (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Climatic changes are likely to cause range contractions in this species's already highly restricted breeding range (Kear 2005a), and are already causing other species (e.g. Canada Geese Branta canadensis) to move northward, increasing competition for resources (Kear 2005a, Fox et al. 2006). Oil exploration in the tundra habitat poses a threat to the species's breeding (Kear 2005a) and moulting sites (Glahder and Walsh 2006) by increasing the possibility of oil spills and chronic oil pollution (Grishanov 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), by direct habitat destruction (influencing breeding site selection and reducing reproductive success) (Kear 2005a) and through human disturbance (Glahder and Walsh 2006).

Mikander in litt. 2016). Disturbance by hunters can be a significant limiting factor on survival and breeding output (Ebbinge and Spaans 1995, N. Petkov in litt. 2007). Illegal spring hunting and round-ups of moulting birds are taking place on the Russian breeding grounds (Jones in press) and illegal shooting continues in Norway (T. Aarvak pers. comm. 2007). In autumn and winter, illegal killing (including by poisoning; A. Fox in litt. 2016) and accidental shooting on the staging and wintering grounds is the most important threat (Madsen 1996, Aarvak et al.1997, Lorentsen et al. 1998, Kear 2005, Morozov 2006, Jones in press). In the Western Palearctic, at least 20-30% of the population are shot each year (Mooij 2010), often accidentally during hunting of other species. Habitat deterioration, as a result of land cultivation and increased water-levels in the Caspian Sea, is a further threat (Madsen 1996), as is habitat loss through the creation of reservoirs for hydroelectric power in Scandinavia (Madsen 1996). The species may also be threatened by nest predation from the Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and Arctic Fox Alopex lagopus (Madsen 1996, V. Morozov in litt. 2016). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and others dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 28% of the habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler and Lysenko 2000). The wintering population at Dongting Lake, China, is considered to now be relatively stable, but the concentration of the majority of birds in this population at one site makes it extremely vulnerable to any factor that could affect this locality (Cong et al. 2012), most notably with changing hydrology and water quality of the Yangtze River (A. Fox in litt. 2016). This is especially the case because the species is reliant on specialist recessional grasslands in spring and autumn (Wang et al. 2012, 2013). In the region of Kaliningrad, Russia, important migratory stop-over points on the Baltic Sea coastline are being degraded through petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for agriculture, changes in wetland management leading to scrub and reed overgrowth, peat extraction, and the burning and mowing of reed beds (Grishanov 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,11.4 years

Other threats to western populations include the loss and degradation of inland wetlands through subterranean water extraction for irrigation (Popovkina 2006) (leading to decreasing water supplies for seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands), widespread drainage of shallow marshes and lakes (Scott and Rose 1996), salt extraction (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Green et al. 2002, Popovkina 2006), urban development, pollution, introduction of exotic fish and overgrazing (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Green et al. 2002, Popovkina 2006).

However, hunting itself is now thought to be in decline (Moores 1996, Moores et al. 2010). In China and South Korea, birds are killed by poisoned grain; pesticide poisoning and pollution from agricultural and household wastes are thought to be a serious problem in the Geum River, South Korea (Degtyarev et al. 2006). Large declines in the numbers of Anatidae have occurred in Sanjiang plain and Poyang Hu, China, as a result of habitat loss to agricultural development and hunting. Wintering sites in South Korea are largely unprotected and threatened by the development of wetlands (N. Moores in litt. 2010); there has been a recent proposal for building the largest tourist development in northeast Asia on the Haenem reclamation site, a key site for wintering Baikal Teal (C. Moores in litt. 2005). Also, its habit of forming dense aggregations in winter renders the species susceptible to infectious diseases; 10,000 birds were recorded dead owing to avian cholera in October, 2002 (Degtyarev et al. 2006). The species suffers from disturbance at the Geum River with up to 12 incidences per day of disturbance from low flying aircraft (Degtyarev et al. 2006).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,6.6 years

Other threats to this species include the destruction of nests during the early mowing of meadows (Kear 2005b), increased human disturbance (Kear 2005b), lead poisoning, botulism during hot summers (Kear 2005b) and hunting disturbance in Africa and Europe (Vaananen 2001) (> 500,000 are shot annually in Russia, Ukraine, France and Poland) (Kear 2005b). The invasive species American Mink Mustela vison also poses a threat through nest predation (Opermanis et al. 2001), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza (particularly strain H5N1) so is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Non-breeding On its wintering grounds in Nigeria and Senegal the species is threatened by habitat destruction through dam construction, vegetation overgrowth and desertification (del Hoyo 1992, Polet 2000, Triplett and Yesou 2000), and in West Africa it is threatened by large-scale river diversion and irrigation schemes (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also at risk from avian influenza in its African wintering grounds (Gaidet et al. 2007) as well as in its breeding areas (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The proportion of the species which migrates via the West Siberian flyway is susceptible to West Nile Virus, and is therefore threatened by future outbreaks (Ternovoi et al. 2004). Utilisation This species is hunted in Denmark , but there is evidence that this may be sustainable (Bregnballe et al. 2006). The species is also hunted for commercial and recreational purposes in Gilan Province, northern Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,6.5 years

It is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) and avian botulism (Forrester et al. 1980), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. The species may suffer from reproductive impairment as a result of selenium accumulation in liver tissues (selenium contained in sub-surface agricultural drain-water used for wetland management in California led to bioaccumulation of the element in the food chain) (Paveglio et al. 1997).

The loss of habitat is thought to primarily result from changes in land management; either the abandonment or intensification of management of lowland marshes and fish ponds (Fox et al. 2016). The abandonment of traditional lowland grazing marshes results in succession to scrub and other unsuitable habitats, whilst greater agricultural intensification leads to marshes being drained. Negative changes to fish pond management also arise from either a reduction in fish production or an intensification that leads to greater use of fish food and medication treatments, and an increase in nutrient inputs (Fox et al. 2016).The species suffers from predation and nest predation by several introduced and native mammals including American Mink Neovison vison (Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003), Raccoon Dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, Raccoon Procyon lotor, Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and Wild Boar Sus scrofa. Increased predation levels may be partly related to declines in Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus colonies, with which Pochard often associate for the benefits of predator deterrence; pochard breeding in association with gull colonies apparently benefit from elevated breeding success and female survival (Fox et al. 2016; Väänänen et al. 2016). Invasive carp Cyprinus carpio may also provide competition for resources with this species, and have been shown to negatively impact the Pochard (Maceda-Veiga et al. 2017). The species may also be threatened by disturbance from hunting (del Hoyo et al. 1992; Evans and Day 2002; Kear 2005; Balmaki and Barati 2006; Sorrenti et al. 2006; H. Ibrahim in litt. 2016), water-based recreation (Fox et al. 1994, Kear 2005) and from machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000). Pochard are permitted for hunting in several eastern European states, which selects for breeding females and naïve juveniles (Fox et al., 2016). The European hunting bag for the Pochard remains high in proportion to declining populations across the Continent (Hirschfeld et al., 2019). Brochet et al., (2019) estimates 30,000 birds are illegally killed/taken per year in North & Central Europe and Caucasus, 5% of the population here, with Azerbaijan responsible for the largest number. This amounts to an estimated 2% of the global population. Eggs have also been sold in the UK. Adults are poisoned by ingesting lead shot (Spain) (Mateo et al. 1998), with one estimate that it accounts for the death of 56,511 Pochard in Europe each year (Andreotti et al. in press); and drowned in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm (China) (Quan et al. 2002). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Emerging threats include climate change and changes to sex ratios. Pochard have a narrow ecological niche, particularly with respect to water conditions which are sensitive to climate change. For example, Jeppesen et al., (2015) highlighted how climate change can synergistically act with water abstraction, leading to salinity increases at wetlands and leaving them unsuitable for Pochard. There is also evidence of an increasingly male-biased sex ratio (Brides et al. 2017), believed to be due to increasing female mortality (suggestions for this include migration stress, and greater predation hunting risk during the breeding season) which may be contributing to global population declines.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,5.47 years

However, the principal threats are thought to be habitat loss and degradation, particularly from drainage and rice cultivation, and unsustainable exploitation for food, both of fledged birds and eggs (R. Hearn in litt. 2016). It seems likely that the long-term decline was caused predominantly by habitat loss, and the apparent recent exacerbation of the decline is due to over-harvesting of what had already become a small and localised population (R. Hearn in litt. 2016).Hearn (2015b) assessed threats the species to include habitat loss and degradation, unsustainable harvesting, disturbance and recreation, bycatch in fishing nets, hybridisation, and pesticides and fertilisers.Habitat loss and degradation is probably greatest in the breeding areas, particularly in China north of Beijing where extensive wetland loss has occurred since the 1950s primarily as a result of agricultural development. For instance in Heilongjiang, wetland loss for farming (predominantly rice production) has exceeded 70% in some areas (Liu et al. 2005) and a similar pattern has occurred elsewhere in northeast China, e.g. in the Songnen Plain, Jilin Province (Wang et al. 2011). Recently discovered breeding sites at fishponds in the Yangtze floodplain are under threat from changes in use and drainage, e.g. at Huangpi (near Wuhan, Hubei) around half of the habitat used by breeding Baer’s Pochard in 2014 was lost before the 2015 breeding season (Hearn 2015a, Lu et al. 2015). Wintering sites are also under threat from habitat loss and degradation. Large-scale habitat alteration has taken place in the Yangtze floodplain due to conversion of wetlands for agriculture, resulting in a large area of natural wetland being lost, estimated to be 62% between the 1950s and the 1980s. Candaba Swamp in the Philippines where the species has been recorded in winter as a vagrant is under imminent threat of land conversion (Roberts 2015).Unsustainable harvesting, both trapping and poisoning of birds and the collection of eggs, is a major threat faced by many Asian waterbirds. The traditional harvesting of wild animals, including birds, has increased dramatically in the past decade, and is now a major cause of decline for some wild fauna, probably including some waterbird species. Although the scale of this is currently hard to quantify for Baer’s Pochard (as no wide-ranging quantitative assessments have been undertaken), it could be significant, particularly in China where illegal poisoning and trapping of waterbirds is widespread, indiscriminate (MaMing et al. 2012) and continuing to worsen (MaMing per R. Hearn in litt. 2016), and the scale of egg collection, whilst unknown, is also probably widespread and highly organised and is also thought to be concentrated in northeast China, within the breeding range of Baer’s Pochard (MaMing per R. Hearn in litt. 2016). Incidents of the use of poisoned baits have also been recorded at wintering locations for Baer's Pochard in Bangladesh which have the potential to cause significant mortality from a single incident (Chowdhury et al. 2012).Additionally, in several cases, the loss of populations from former important areas have been preceded by low water levels or complete drying up of water bodies (e.g. the loss of the breeding population at Xianghai Reserve and the wintering population at Baiquan wetlands in Wuhan [J. Hornskov in litt. 2005, S. Chowdhury in litt. 2010, W. Xin, C. Lei, L. Jinyu and T. Fox in litt. 2012]). Development for tourism and recreational watersports pose a threat to the species's habitat (Townshend 2014), particularly at Hengshui Hu, Henan, China (one of the most important known breeding sites) (R. Hearn in litt. 2016). Incidents of hunting by the use of poisoned baits have been recorded at wintering locations for Baer's Pochard in Bangladesh. which have the potential to cause significant mortality from a single incident (Chowdhury et al. 2012). Hybridisation with Ferruginous Duck, Aythya nyroca, is also a potential threat (N. Moores in litt. 2014, R. Hearn in litt. 2016).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,7.6 years

Changing land management practices such as reed cutting and burning during the breeding season, over-grazing, decreased grazing and mowing of wet meadows, and abandonment (causing succession to scrub) or intensification (causing reversion to open water) of extensively managed fishponds also threatens the species (Vinicombe 2000, Kear 2005, Petkov 2006, Robinson and Hughes 2006). The introduction of non-native species has caused further habitat degradation. For example, the stocking of lakes with and accidental introduction of Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella has resulted in reductions in macrophyte biomass and corresponding reductions in invertebrate biomass (Kear 2005, Robinson and Hughes 2006), and in Bulgaria an introduced shrub (Desert False Indigo Amorpha fruticosa) is changing the ecological character of wetlands (Robinson and Hughes 2006). Introduced predators such as the Wels Catfish Silurus glanis (Kazakhstan) that predate ducklings, and the Muskrat Ondatra zibethicus (Aral Sea region) have also caused population declines (Robinson and Hughes 2006). Increased drought due to global climate change may pose a threat to the species in part of its range (Vinicombe 2000, Robinson and Hughes 2006). Disturbance by fishing boats and anglers alongside fringe vegetation could cause abandonment of the breeding sites or disrupt the timing of breeding (N. Petkov in litt. 2008). Hunting is another serious threat to the species (Vinicombe 2000, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Robinson and Hughes 2006). Large numbers are shot on passage in the autumn (e.g. through the Volga delta) and on the wintering grounds (e.g. Sudan) (Kear 2005, Balmaki and Barati 2006). Illegal and accidental hunting also persists in most European countries (Brochet et al. 2018). Other lower-level threats include lead poisoning (from ingestion of discarded lead shot), fires in areas of reed thickets, peat bogs and woods, entanglement and drowning in fishing nets and hybridisation with native species (e.g. Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula and Common Pochard Aythya ferina) (Grishanov 2006, Robinson and Hughes 2006, Leuzinger 2010).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,7.6 years

It also suffers decreased reproductive success as a result of disturbance from increased recreational use of inland waterbodies (Kear 2005a), machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000), hunting (Evans and Day 2002) and predation by American mink Neovison vison on islands (Nordstrom et al. 2002).

Entanglement in fishing equipment causes an estimated 5-10% annual mortality in the Baltic region (Jensen 2009). The species winters near major fishing areas in Europe, North America and Japan, thus interaction with fisheries is common throughout the range.  Wetland habitats critical to breeding success are potentially threatened by climate change. Remotely sensed imaging has revealed landscape-level changes, including the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska, associated with a warming climate, longer growing seasons and increased potential evapotranspiration (Riordan et al. 2006). Audubon’s (2014) climate model predicts the loss of over half of the North American summer range with suitable climatic conditions, with similar trends likely in Eurasia. Climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes throughout the sensitive ecosystems in the Arctic region (Fox et al. 2015). Reduced duration of spring snow cover in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Greater Scaup, possibly due to trophic mismatch, with a projected 12.9% decline in population by 2080, compared to the 1980 census (Drever et al. 2011). Future ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Scaup diet (Steinacher et al. 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Certain colonies in the Pacific Northwest may be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium originating from mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, raising the possibility that heavy metal pollution could be contributory to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). The Scaup’s habit of congregating around coastal sewage outlets in winter, also exposes it to risk from other pollutants (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Flocks often occur in vicinity of oil-related developments and are therefore susceptible to oiling and related pollutants, particularly when moulting and during winter. Oil pollution could also impact the species indirectly through decreased abundance or quality of invertebrate prey (Kirby et al. 1993, Kear 2005). Oil and gas exploration in Siberia may have disruptive impacts on breeding grounds and could potentially be associated with an increase in hunting pressures (Jensen 2009, Mineyev 1998). Wind farms may represent a threat to the Greater Scaup, having been shown to affect duck population densities more severely than those of other species groups (Stewart et al. 2007). However, it has been found that collision rates are lower than for other groups (Dürr 2013 per Fox et al. 2015) and, as such, wind farms are likely to only be damaging to the population when inappropriately placed (Drewitt & Langston 2006).  At present, direct persecution only appears to have a low impact on a minority of the population, with annual mortality in the EU estimated at 0.6% (Mooji 2005) or not more than 2% (Jensen 2009). In the last 10-year period with available data (2004-2014), the estimated harvest of Greater Scaup in US and Canada ranged from 56,000 to 104,000 birds and showed a decreasing trend in population size (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). Another study in North America found little evidence that harvest was  associated with population decline (Afton and Anderson 2001). Low levels of hunting have also been reported in north-western Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006). Although wintering in densely populated coastal areas (Europe, N. America, Japan) makes the species an exposed hunting target, persecution is thought to have negligible effects on the population as a whole.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,8.2 years

The species may also suffer from resource competition with commercial fisheries exploiting marine benthic organisms and shellfish (Kear 2005).  Climate change is expected to impact this species in a number of ways. Remote sensing has shown the shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in Siberia which provide important breeding grounds for this species (Smith et al. 2005). In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox et al. 2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration has been linked to declining Scoter populations in North America and this is likely due to trophic mismatch, so may also affect Siberian populations (Drever et al. 2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Siberian Scoter diet (Steinacher et al. 2009, del Hoyo et al. 2017). During moulting and winter aggregations, the species is highly susceptible to oil spills and other marine pollutants (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005) and one catastrophic oil spill could potentially destroy a large proportion of the global population if it occurred in a key moulting or wintering area (Madge and Burn 1988). Oil and gas exploration is a pervasive threat in the Arctic and is likely to increase in the future (Poland et al. 2003, Henderson and Loe 2014), with human exploitation of natural resources in the taiga and lower tundra regions of its breeding range causing habitat degradation (Kear 2005).  The footprint of large offshore wind farms may exclude Siberian Scoter from some foraging areas and through disturbance, as it does reduce duck densities more than other seabird groups (Garthe and Hüppop 2004, Stewart et al. 2007), however the impact on other scoter species appears minor and the majority of the Siberian Scoter's range does not have any current plans for large-scale wind farms. Collision mortality is also likely to be a minor threat as collisions rates between ducks and wind turbines are low compared with other species groups, which is consistent with their high avoidance rates at offshore wind farms (Fox et al. 2015).  There is a small risk that future outbreaks of H5N1 (avian influenza) could pose a risk to the species (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is mostly asymptomatic in wild birds and there is no record of significant mortality in this species.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,None

Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions have been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever et al. 2011), and future ocean acidification may lead to sustained declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher et al. 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten the species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while oil drilling sites could also cause low-level impacts through human disturbance and degradation of food resources (Gorski et al. 1977, Nikolaeva et al. 2006). In parts of the range, avoidance of busy shipping areas by flocks of the species could displace flocks from preferred feeding areas. Hunting represents another threat to the species, with an average of 9,500 birds reported to be shot annually in the US and an additional 7,000 per year in Canada through the 1980s and 1990s. However, the actual number killed may have been much higher with maximum estimates exceeding 24,000 in the US in 1974 and 23,000 annually in Canada between 1974 and 1982 (Bordage and Savard 2011). Since this period, numbers of hunters have decreased considerably and the annual harvest has fallen concomitantly. The species is susceptible to avian influenza and may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is unlikely to affect the majority of the population at once and only small numbers of birds tested in various countries have developed the disease despite evident exposure to the virus. High-speed ferries can cause disturbance to this species (Larsen and Laubek 2005). In some areas, the breeding habitat is threatened by eutrophication from agricultural nutrient loads (Kear 2005).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5.3 years

The main threat to the species in its wintering range is pollution, e.g. from coastal oil spills or other pollutants from sewage outfalls (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Modern forestry management work is also limiting the suitable area of breeding habitat by removing old and decaying trees with likely nest holes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The timber industry is thought to be compromising the population in large parts of the range. The placing of nest-boxes to compensate for the loss of natural nesting sites has not been very effective, as the species reaches an apparent density-dependent plateau in breeding success (Finland), which may indicate that nesting resource is not the primary limiting factor constraining the population. However, in other parts of the species' range (North America) use of nest-boxes has been found to increase the breeding range and productivity of Common Goldeneye. Historically, an estimated 100,000–250,000 were shot annually in north-west and central Europe. The species is still hunted at sustainable levels in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006), while hunting elsewhere has unquantified effects on the global populations (Kear 2005), though not thought to drive any significant declines. Lead shot ingestion does not appear to be a significant risk, at least when compared to some other species of seaducks (Carboneras et al. 2014). The introduction of invertebrate-eating fish such as Perch, Perca spp., to many lakes where they were not formerly present leads to increased resource competition which has been experimentally shown to negatively affect the Common Goldeneye (Nummi et al. 2016).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,8 years

The level of impact from direct persecution is currently unknown (Craik et al. 2015). The species is also hunted in North America (Kear 2005) and Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006), although it appears to be a less popular game species (Kear 2005). Eggs used to be, and possibly still are, harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).It may also threatened by accidental entanglement and drowning in fishing nets (Kear 2005). Alterations to its breeding habitats by dam construction and deforestation, and habitat degradation from water pollution could represent threats (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species is susceptible to avian influenza and may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).

The most significant threat to the eastern flyway is a proposed dam at the outlet of Poyang Lake to stabilize water flows for navigation, irrigation, and other economic purposes–to be built in part in response to impacts of the Three Gorges Dam on water levels in the Yangtze River. Management of water levels to sustain ecosystem function will be critical to the long-term viability of this species (Harris and Zhuang 2010). Severe drought caused Poyang Lake to shrink dramatically in the winters of 2003-2004, 2006-2007 (Anon 2007), and 2010-2011. The most recent drought forced birds to feed in sub-optimal upland habitat. Construction of the Three Gorges Dam changed the hydrological pattern of the lower Yangtze river and may have a major impact on the wintering population, as may the quantity of sand-dredging that is also occurring along the Yangtze (Larson 2018). In Western Siberia the establishment of oilfields and associated urban developments are significant causes of habitat loss and degradation (Van Impe 2013).Increasing levels of human disturbance are also a problem, particularly at Poyang Lake, where crab farming may restrict access to high-quality foraging habitat (Burnham et al. 2017). Along eastern migration routes, water has been diverted from the Zhalong and Momoge National Nature Reserve for human use. Although water releases to sustain wetland functions have been negotiated, sustaining these releases over the long term will be important, especially for Momoge. Also canals and fragmentation within the reserve have altered water flow. Limited fresh water has caused marshes in the Huanghe Delta National Reserve to dry up, and the harvesting of reeds by people has seriously disturbed cranes (Shan Kai et al. 2007). A hydro-electric scheme is also proposed for the headwaters of the Aldan River basin, the construction of power lines northwards to Yakutsk, and oil and gas prospecting (Prentice and Stishov 2007). Overhunting of Alces alces reduces availability of rhizomes and roots usually exposed by trampling (Degtyarev and Sleptsov 2013). Disturbance from boating activities is also a problem at stopover sites. Hunting on passage and wintering grounds in Iran is the key threat to the Central/Western population (G. Sundar in litt. 2004), and inhibits recovery. Poisoning targeted at waterbirds in China, e.g. Huanzidong Reservoir, Shenyang Region, may also affect this species. Pesticide use and pollution is a threat in India. Climate change may be a long term threat to breeding sites, with changes in the permafrost layer causing expansion of lakes and the loss of islands, peninsulas and low-lying shorelines (Harris 2008, Van Impe 2013). The expansion of lakes and subsequent habitat modification has been on-going in the breeding grounds of the eastern population since the 1950s (Pshennikov and Germogenov 2008).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,13 years

Breeding In parts of its breeding range that are heavily developed the species is threatened by nest disturbance from tourism and recreation which reduces its breeding success by increasing the incidence of successful nest predation by corvids, wild boar and foxes (Meine and Archibald 1996). Egg collecting is also a threat to the breeding population in Turkey (Meine and Archibald 1996). Non-breeding Along its migrational routes and in its wintering grounds the Common Crane is particularly threatened by habitat fragmentation and the loss of many smaller traditional feeding and roosting sites, leading to increasing concentrations of large flocks in smaller areas, and therefore increased competition (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Alonso et al. 1994, Meine and Archibald 1996). Pesticide poisoning may also be affecting cranes along migration routes and in some wintering areas, especially where they depend primarily on grain from agricultural fields (Meine and Archibald 1996). Collisions with utility lines are frequent in highly developed areas along migration routes and in winter ranges (collisions being the leading cause of adult mortality at wintering areas in Spain) (Meine and Archibald 1996). Hunting is a significant threat to this species on migration (e.g. through Afghanistan and Pakistan) (Meine and Archibald 1996, Nawaz et al. 2006) and illegal shooting has been identified as a problem in other areas (including Portugal, southeast Europe, Egypt and Sudan) (Meine and Archibald 1996).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,13.4 years

The species suffers from the transformation of wetlands by destruction, pollution or recreational use but this is often offset by construction of man-made ponds, reservoirs and dams, leading to expansion of species in many areas (Llimona et al. 2014). Utilisation The species is hunted for commercial (sold as food) and recreational purposes in Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,5.4 years

Afforestation can lead to hydrological changes that reduce the availability of invertebrate prey to the grebe, and climate change appears to be having similar impacts through the drying of wetlands leading to overgrowth by plants, especially in the southern part of the range (A. Mischenko in litt. 2017). Dams also impact habitat suitability, however, they are likely to only impact a small minority of the population and may also provide additional habitat in parts of the range. There has also been a loss of habitat to agricultural development and rural development across the range, for example more than ten percent of the overall five percent decrease in wetland area in the Prairies of Canada was due to land being built upon (COSEWIC 2009). Development is likely to also bring disturbance to the birds, which may cause nest abandonment (Stedman 2018). Despite this, the species' range remains very large and, as such, these threats are likely to only affect a small fraction of the population. Many freshwater sites throughout the breeding range have become eutrophied through agricultural run-off, which is thought to degrade the nutritional quality of the prey base and nutrient status of the water has been related to breeding success in Scotland (Summers et al. 2011). The introduction of large fish, such as the Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, to many inland water bodies is likely to result in resource competition for invertebrate and small fish prey (HELCOM 2013). It is not clear that trout are actually affecting a majority of the global population, as no impact detected in a study in Scotland (Summers et al. 2011) which indicated that pike was a more significant source of mortality.Horned Grebes are commonly caught and accidentally drowned in fishing nets (del Hoyo et al. 1992), with bycatch in nearshore gill-nets  a potential significant source of mortality in much of the range as they appear highly susceptible to capture (more so than seaduck when accoutning for abundance) (Zydelis et al. 2013). The species is also particularly vulnerable to oil spills in the marine environment during the winter (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Ogilvie and Rose 2003, Fjeldså 2004, COSEWIC 2009). While relatively large numbers have been reported killed by a single large event (Stedman 2018), only a small proportion of the global population would be impacted across the large winter distribution.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,7.1 years

These reductions are likely due to an increase in salinity of the lake reducing overall pileworm productivity and increasing water column stratification. This results in the production of anoxic conditions with high sulphide levels in deeper water, subsequent weather-mediated mixing events bring this water to the surface, killing pileworms and resulting in the death of grebes too weak to move onto better wintering grounds by starvation (Anderson et al. 2007). Populations have also been known to crash in winter habitats during El Niño Southern Oscillation events due to reductions in food availability due to warming sea-surface temperatures, although they rebound to previous levels afterwards (Jehl et al. 2002).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,7.1 years

In Nepal the species is seriously threatened by disturbance and the degradation and loss of its riverine habitat. The multitude of hydroelectric dam  projects completed, underway and  planned on large rivers in its range,  which threaten to alter flow  regimes and inundate nesting habitat downstream, is now perhaps the most significant threat across much of the range. On the Sesan and Sekong rivers in Cambodia, the species has nearly disappeared (A. Claassen in litt. 2013). This recent precipitous decline on the Sesan is probably due to upstream Vietnamese dams (sudden water level rises inundating nests), and imminent extinction there seems unavoidable, and with further dams planned the fate of the small Sekong population does not seem more promising, even if appropriate conservation actions are implemented (Goes in press). Planned hydro-power dams on the main Mekong channel in southern Laos,  at Stung Treng and Sambor (Kratie) would lead to major alteration of flood regimes and river ecology if built, and could arguably lead to regional extinction in the medium term (Goes in press).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,10.5 years

Bait digging has also been identified as a threat through loss of prey species and disturbance to the benthic fauna (van de Pol et al. 2014). The species is also threatened by habitat degradation on its wintering grounds due to land reclamation (for example in the Yellow Sea [Melville et al. 2014]), pollution, human disturbance (Kelin & Qiang 2006) (e.g. from construction work or recreational activities [Burton et al. 2002, van de Pol et al. 2014]), coastal barrage construction (Burton 2006), industrial development including development of ports and oil extraction, oil spills, wind farms (Melville et al. 2014) and reduced river flows (Kelin & Qiang 2006). Rapid and extensive land reclamation is reported from staging and wintering grounds for the osculans population in South Korea and China and large-scale planting of Spartina alterniflora on the coast of eastern China may cause loss of foraging and nesting habitats (Melville et al. 2014). Intensive agriculture including frequent mowing of grasslands and high densities of grazing livestock threatens chicks, eggs and nests and high levels of fertilizers and pesticides can reduce soil invertebrate biomass (van de Pol et al. 2014). A reduction in eutrophication is likely to have contributed to declines in some areas, owing to a loss of food resources (van de Pol et al. 2014, H. Meltofte in litt. 2015). Sea level rise leading to increased coastal erosion and flooding is contributing to habitat loss in some areas (Melville et al. 2014, van de Pol et al. 2014). Climate change has advanced the average egg-laying date of the species and is likely to reduce recruitment of bivalves, however warmer winters are expected to benefit the species leading to lower winter mortality (van de Pol et al. 2014). Droughts in some inland areas are likely to lead to a loss of suitable habitat (Melville et al. 2014, Sarychev & Mischenko 2014). The species is hunted in France but the effects of hunting at the population level are not known (van de Pol et al. 2014). It may be subject to subsistence egg collection in China (Melville et al, 2014) and illegal hunting elsewhere (Sarychev & Mischenko 2014). Eggs and chicks are known to be predated by Corvidae, gulls, American Mink Neovison vison, dogs and foxes Vulpes vulpes (Sarychev & Mischenko 2014). The invasive Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas has become abundant in the Oosterschelde (Netherlands) and is increasing in the Dutch Wadden Sea (van de Pol et al. 2014). Eurasian Oystercatcher generally does not eat this species of oyster which is reported to be invading mussel beds and may compete with cockles and mussels thus reducing food availability. However Pacific Oyster beds could also provide an area for mussel beds to re-establish. The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville & Shortridge 2006).In the northern part of the longipes population breeding range, cessation of grazing in coastal areas leading to development of shrubby vegetation threatens breeding habitats (Sarychev and Mischenko 2014). Conversely, intensive grazing in some areas may pose a threat to this population. Pollution from sewage, heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides have been identified as potential threats for the osculans population (Melville et al. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,13.7 years

It is estimated that up to 65% of intertidal habitat in the Yellow Sea has been lost over the past 50 years, with the rate of habitat loss estimated at >1% every year (Murray et al. 2014). This scale of habitat loss is predicted to continue owing to growing populations around the Yellow Sea. It is difficult to ascertain whether declines seen at reclaimed sites such as Saemangeum represent true declines, or whether the birds have simply been displaced (Moores et al. in litt. 2008, D. Rogers in litt. 2009), but the former seems more probable, given the huge scale of habitat loss in the Yellow Sea. Wetland degradation in the Yellow Sea may affect the species where it stages on migration (Bamford et al. 2008, van de Kam et al. 2010). Further threats may include disturbance at the nesting and feeding sites  (Taylor & Bester 1999 in Conservation Advice 2015), direct persecution throughout its range, and a decrease in the availability of food due to pollution at stopover points in South Korea. Furthermore, females probably tend to migrate further south to southern Australian wetlands which are more threatened than those in northern Australia (del Hoyo et al. 1996). ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,10.1 years

The species also suffers from high egg and chick mortalities due to agricultural practices (e.g. Tuellinghoff & Bergmann 1993, Grant 1997, Fisher & Walker 2015) human disturbance (Boschert and Rupp 1993) and higher predation rates if nesting on improved grasslands or in fragmented landscapes (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Valkama and Korpimäki 1999, Douglas et al. 2014). Conversely some populations have declined following abandonment of farmland and subsequent increases in the height of vegetation (Broyer and Roche 1991), rendering large areas unsuitable for nesting. Climate change is projected to have a large negative impact on this species during the breeding season (Huntley et al. 2007, Renwick et al. 2012). Expansion of renewable energy projects including wind farms can also have an impact although more studies are required (Pearce-Higgins et al. 2009). It has also suffered population declines as a result of hunting (Johnsgard 1981), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Wintering populations are threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Burton et al. 2002a, 2002b) (e.g. from construction work (Burton et al. 2002a) and foot-traffic (Burton et al. 2002b)), development on high-tide roosting sites, pollution (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and the flooding of estuarine mudflats and saltmarshes as a result of tidal barrage construction (Burton 2006, Porter et al. 2008). The species is also threatened by the degradation of migrational staging areas owing to land reclamation, pollution, human disturbance and reduced river flows (Kelin and Qiang 2006). Local populations of this species have also declined owing to hunting pressures (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and mechanised shellfish harvesting (Taylor and Dodd 2013).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5 years

Climate change has the potential to affect vegetation and the extent of suitable breeding habitat (P. Battley in litt. 2016).The species is threatened by the degradation of stopover and non-breeding sites due to land reclamation, shellfisheries, pollution, human disturbance, reduced river flows, and in some areas the invasion of mudflats and coastal saltmarshes by mangroves (owing to sea-level rise and increased sedimentation and nutrient loads at the coast from uncontrolled development and soil erosion in upstream catchment areas) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Kelin and Qiang 2006, Straw and Saintilan 2006, Melville et al. 2016). Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of wetland areas at non-breeding sites can also cause cyanobacterium blooms that may impact this species's prey species (Estrella et al. 2011).Loss of intertidal stopover habitats due to reclamation activities in the Yellow Sea region of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is thought to be driving declines in shorebird populations (Amano et al. 2010, Yang et al. 2011, Leyrer et al. 2014, Choi et al. 2015, Melville et al. 2016, Piersma et al. 2016). It is estimated that up to 65% of tidal flats in the Yellow Sea region have been lost over the past five decades, with an annual loss of 1.2% per year since the 1980s (Murray et al. 2014), and the Republic of Korea having lost 75% of its mudflats by 2010 (Moores et al. 2016). These losses are attributed to urban, industrial and agricultural expansion within the region.Development elsewhere in the species's range is also considered a threat to important habitat: potential oil and gas extraction activities and commercial and industrial development threaten staging and non-breeding grounds in West Africa, the Middle East and the Wadden Sea, while rapid residential, commercial and industrial development in West Africa and the Middle East threatens staging and wintering grounds (Leyrer et al. 2014). Although not currently detected in certain populations (e.g. in Australia [Curran et al. 2014]), the species has also been susceptible to avian influenza in the past so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). This species may be hunted in some range states, with anecdotal evidence from individuals carrying transmitters being shot (P. Battley in litt. 2016, J. Szabo in litt. 2016).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,8.9 years

Detrimental activities include the conversion of wet meadows to arable land and loss of habitat to development (Tucker and Heath 1994), increased fertilisation and drainage of grassland (Roodbergen and Teunissen 2014), earlier and more frequent cutting as farmers adapt to climate change (Kleijn et al. 2010), spring burning and scrub encroachment (A. Mischenko in litt. 2007) and possibly disturbance by walkers (Holm and Laursen 2009). Increasing populations of predators to possibly unnatural levels is a significant cause of egg and chick mortality in the Netherlands, exacerbated by intensive farming reducing available cover for the species (Schekkerman et al. 2009, Kentie et al. 2015). On intensively grazed pastures, trampling is a major cause of nest loss, and a switch to monoculture on arable land reduces the supply of insects on which the species feeds (Kentie et al. 2013). In some areas, grassland turnover from 'natural, flower-rich, diverse and wet' to silage monoculture leads to a loss of nests with eggs and chicks due to mowing and starvation of chicks due to a lack of food (Schekkerman and Beintema 2007). A study in the central regions of European Russia suggests that significant decline in spring flood levels during two last decades, as a result climate change, has strengthened the negative impact of agricultural abandonment (A. Mischenko in litt. 2016). Habitat fragmentation may cause problems for this species, which nests in dispersed colonies and sub-colonies as protection against predators hence productivity may be low in such areas. Indeed, sink locations have been documented for the species, where birds recruited from good quality habitat disperse to low quality habitats (often suffering high predation) effectively losing these individuals to the population. This has repercussions for the effectiveness of agri-environment measures (Kentie et al. 2015, Leigh et al. 2016). There is a marked decrease in the density of breeding birds near to roads, particularly those with heavy traffic (van der Zande et al. 1980, Reijnen et al. 1996). Natal philopatry means that a decrease in local recruitment could prove catastrophic for individual breeding sites (Kruk et al. 1998). The Icelandic population is potentially at risk from the policy of the Icelandic government to encourage afforestion of the lowland habitats where they breed and from ongoing agricultural expansion (Gunnarsson et al. 2006, Gill et al. 2007), although this population has been increasing strongly over recent decades (BirdLife International 2015).Threats on migration include pollution, human disturbance, habitat reclamation for tidal energy plants, aquaculture ponds, land conversion for agriculture, urban expansion and agricultural intensification at rice paddies. The proposed development of a new airport near Lisbon is likely to have negative implications on an important site for migratory birds (Gill et al. 2007, Masero et al. 2011). Hunting has been another significant threat, although France has now followed the rest of the European Union (EU) in implementing a five-year ban on hunting of the species, beginning in 2008 (I. Burfield in litt. 2008), which was extended in 2013 for a further five years. Outside the EU, for example on the African wintering grounds, hunting is known to occur but its scale and impact is unknown. Water pollution is probably an issue in parts of the species range (H. Hötker in litt. 2005), although the effects of the release of some pollutants, like untreated sewage, on this species may be minor as long as there are several alternative prey present at a site (Alves et al. 2012). In Egypt there are plans to increase the depth of the sailing channel of the Nile, impacting upon this species's habitat there (H. Ibrahim in litt. 2016). Drought in the West African wintering quarters may have had negative impacts on the mainland European population (Tucker and Heath 1994) in conjunction with the extensive drainage of wetlands in this area, for energy production, water storage and agriculture (Gill et al. 2007). Invasive plants may also degrade wintering habitat in Australia (Garnett et al. 2011). Studies of islandica godwits have shown that individuals breeding in the habitats where productivity is higher also winter in the areas where survival is higher (Gunnarsson et al. 2005), therefore maintaining high quality wintering sites is crucial to raising productivity on breeding grounds. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,8.6 years

Up to 65% of intertidal habitat in the Yellow Sea has been lost  over the past 50 years with habitat loss estimated at a rate of >1% annually (Murray et al. 2014). Losses are attributed to reclamation for agriculture,  aquaculture, and other development and are expected to continue or accelerate owing to population growth around the Yellow Sea. Degradation and loss of wetland habitats in the Yellow Sea region are also attributed to environmental pollution (Kelin and Qiang 2006) (e.g. oil contamination of intertidal mudflats) (Tomkovich 1997), reduced river flows and human disturbance (Kelin and Qiang 2006) (e.g. from off-road vehicles, tourists and hunters) (Tomkovich 1997).In South Korea, after the loss of the important Saemangeum stopover area and almost all of the tidal-flats in Asan Bay and much of Namyang bay, possibly only five sites nationwide remain internationally important. Of these, only one (the Geum Estuary) currently has a low risk of reclamation, with the other four at risk due to the construction of tidal power plants and barrages, industrial use and urban expansion (N. Moores in litt. 2009). Benthic food stocks used by the species reportedly crashed at Yalujiang NNR, Liaoning in 2014 and 2015 (D. Melville in litt. 2015). In 2015, most birds departed Yalujiang and moved to northern Bohai, however, it seems unlikely that this site will exist in five years time, owing to extensive reclamation works (D. Melville in litt. 2015). In the Philippines, India and Australia other threats may include mangrove afforestation, habitat degradation caused by intense fishing activities and harvesting of molluscs and bivalves, infrastructure projects, aquaculture, oil spills and invasive alien plant species (Leyrer et al. 2014). The species is also potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its global distribution is restricted to within c. 10o latitude from the polar edge of continent and within which 20-50% of current vegetation type is projected to disappear under doubling of CO2 levels (BirdLife International unpublished data).

It is estimated that up to 65% of tidal flats in the Yellow Sea region have been lost over the past five decades, with an annual loss of 1.2% per year since the 1980s (Murray et al. 2014). These losses are attributed to urban, industrial and agricultural expansion within the region with the populations of C. c. piersmai and C. c. rogersi both being threatened by development at key staging sites in Bohai Bay, China (Rogers et al. 2010, Yang et al. 2011, Leyrer et al. 2014). It is threatened by the over-exploitation of shellfish (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Goldfeder and Blanco 2006) which leads directly and indirectly to reductions in prey availability (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Damming of rivers, dredging (which reduces food availability), pollution, aquaculture operations, renewable energy developments, oil exploration and invasion of mudflats by Spartina grasses pose additional threats to key habitats (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006, Niles et al. 2010, Leyrer et al. 2014, Melville et al. 2016). The species also suffers from disturbance in the non-breeding season as a result of tourism (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006), residential development (Leyrer et al. 2014) foot-traffic on beaches (Burton et al. 2002, Niles et al. 2010, Lilleyman et al. 2016), recreational activities and over-flying aircraft, which together reduce the size of available foraging areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In the past, increased harvesting of Horseshoe Crab Limulus polyphemus in Delaware Bay, U.S.A. resulted in reduced prey availability (McGowan et al. 2011, Leyrer et al. 2014). The species is hunted illegally for example in New Zealand (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and northern Brazil (Leyrer et al. 2014), and potentially in China (Melville et al. 2016). C. c. islandica and C. c. canutus are both huntable in France and hunting of other species can cause disturbance and accidental mortality. The species can also suffer mortality by incidentally being caught in fish traps (Melville et al. 2016). It has been susceptible to avian influenza in the past so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), although testing since 1992 in northwest Australia has not found any evidence for this disease in the species there (Curran et al. 2014). Climate change induced sea level rise and thawing of permafrost pose threats to intertidal staging areas, non-breeding sites and Arctic breeding areas (Leyrer et al. 2014, Wauchope et al. 2016).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,6.8 years

The habitat area is also shrinking through a combination of restricted inflow of sediments from increasingly dammed rivers (Murray et al. 2014, Melville et al. 2016) and sea level rise with sea walls at many sites preventing suitable habitat migrating inland. There is little understanding of how to manage these threats, whilst there is limited attempts to implement such management knowledge as is available. China stopped major reclamation in early 2018, and designation of migratory bird sanctuaries along the coast of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Gulf as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Melville 2018, UNESCO 2019) should reduce some risks, although major political, social and economic hurdles remain.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,4.9 years

The important staging area at Saemangeum and Geum estuary, South Korea, including the Mangyeung and Tongjin estuaries, has already been reclaimed, and remaining wetlands are under serious threat of reclamation in the near future (Zöckler et al. 2008). Since the reclamation at Saemangeum in 2007, only an average of a single individual has been recorded, in contrast to 'hundreds' prior to the development (Lee et al. 2018). Plans for a large-scale reclamation project on the Tiaozini Sandbanks, (part of the Rudong mudflats) were feared to threatened over 60,000 ha of mudflats used by the species by 2020 (Moores 2015, J. Li and M. Tong to C. Zöckler in litt. 2016, Peng et al. 2017), and elsewhere at Rudong new seawalls were being built in 2015 (Zöckler 2015, Peng et al. 2017). However, the national announcement of an end to the reclamation of intertidal land in January 2018 (Anon. 2018, Lei 2018) appears to be a dramatic shift towards alleviating new impacts from this threat and these sites are included in the World Heritage Site nomination.Smooth Cord-grass Spartina alterniflora is an invasive plant used to stabilise mudflats to assist in reclamation along the Chinese coast and rapidly leaves intertidal areas unsuitable for Spoon-billed Sandpipers, dramatically reducing habitat availability (Menxiu et al. 2012, Peng et al. 2017). At both Rudong and Dongling, Spartina alterniflora has formed dense stands with considerable spread noted between spring 2014 and autumn 2015 (Peng et al. 2017), and it has also been found on Leizhou mudflat (V. Fu in litt. 2017). The Rudong mudflats are also the site for development of the largest wind farm in Asia, which could prove to be another threat to this species (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010, Li et al. undated). Plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia and cross-dams along the coast of Bangladesh continue to pose threats (Bird et al. 2010a, Chowdhury et al. 2011, Zöckler 2015); however, this plan is currently on hold and plans to protect the area have been developed (Zöckler 2015).Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009, Bird et al. 2010b, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler in litt. 2010, Zöckler et al. 2010b, Martinez & Lewthaithe 2013), and this may be a particularly serious threat to birds wintering on Nan Thar Island and in the Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler et al. 2010b). A survey of hunting activities in five villages around Sonadia Island, Bangladesh, in September 2010 found that of the 53 hunters interviewed, eight of them claimed to have caught a total of 22 Spoon-billed Sandpipers between October 2009 and April 2010 (Chowdhury 2010). Hunting in the species's non-breeding range could be a crucial factor in the poor rate of recruitment into the breeding population, as immature birds do not return to the breeding areas until they are two years old and thus are more exposed to capture (Zöckler et al. 2010b). However, recent conservation action aimed at reducing trapping on the wintering grounds appears to have been successful (Clark et al. 2014) and may have reduced this significant source of mortality (D. Pain in litt. 2016, Aung et al. 2016/2017). Large-scale wader trapping was observed at Fucheng, south-west Guangdong province, China, where four Spoon-billed Sandpiper were observed in December 2012 (BirdLife Asia 2013), but surveys for the species in south China in January 2017 did not find any illegal mist nets (V. Fu in litt. 2017). Monofilament fishing nets set over high tides were found to be a serious problem on the central Chinese coast, with multiple parallel lines of nets set at Tiaozini in autumn 2015 were found to have captured scores of birds after just one nocturnal high tide, including one juvenile Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Peng et al. 2017). Hunting with nets has also been reported from Viet Nam (Long 2015). Recently the scale of hunting in the Russian far northeast has been found to be much greater than previously assumed, and may impact the species during the immediate post-breeding period particularly.Between August and October 2014, more than a thousand dead wading birds, including two Spoon-billed Sandpipers, were found on the Tiaozini Sandbanks (Zöckler et al. 2015, Peng et al. 2017). Tests are ongoing to understand the cause of mortality; however, poisoned bait was discovered in the area.There are no immediate threats to the breeding grounds, but nests in the vicinity of villages are sometimes destroyed by dogs (E. Syroechkovskiy in litt. 2007). Poor breeding productivity in recent years has been attributed to heavy nest predation and bad weather (Syroechkovskiy et al. 2009). Significant habitat degradation has been observed in 5 of 30 visited breeding locations (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010). Human disturbance, both by residents and researchers, may cause increased levels of nest desertion and predation by foxes and skuas (Zöckler & Bunting 2006). Shorebirds, including this species, are also occasionally killed by children with slingshots (Zöckler & Bunting 2006); one male was also shot by a Russian hunter near the Chinese border in 2008 (Zöckler & Syroechkovskiy 2008). Small but significant numbers of birds and their eggs have been collected for scientific purposes in the last 20 years, with one small colony completely wiped out due to this activity (Syroechkovsky 2005). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and other species dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 57% of the breeding habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler & Lysenko 2000). Recent observation on the breeding grounds unfortunately confirm a worrying trend of increasing bushes intruding on the coastal tundra habitats in the southern range, as well as drying of the tundra in the northern range with significant consequences on food access for breeding waders (C.

Non-breeding In the winter this species is restricted to a small number of estuaries, so it is vulnerable to any changes in this habitat for example through land reclamation (drainage) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and the invasion of alien plant species (such as the grass Spartina anglica which has spread on British mudflats, resulting in the reduction in size of feeding areas available) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (UK) (Burton et al. 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton et al. 2002b). Important migratory stop-over habitats on the Baltic Sea coastline adjacent to the Kaliningrad region of Russia are threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for irrigation, peat-extraction, reedbed mowing and burning, and abandonment and changing land management practices leading to scrub and reed overgrowth (Grishanov 2006).

Lanctot in litt. 2003). Previously, on-going declines were attributed to widespread and continuing destruction of grasslands in the wintering range (Lanctot and Laredo 1994, Lanctot 1995), but there seems to be little evidence to support this, although environmental contaminants may be playing a part there (R. Lanctot in litt. 2003). Exposure on migration to toxic chemicals and pollutants in its agricultural feeding grounds may pose a threat, and is being investigated further (Lanctot 2006, McCarty et al. 2009).Conservation threats faced by the species vary throughout the annual cycle. On the breeding grounds, habitat is being lost or degraded due to energy production (extraction of oil and gas and associated development) and climate change (Lanctot et al., 2010). Climate change may also be affecting demographic parameters but the overall effects are unclear. Negative effects on Buff-breasted Sandpiper productivity may occur due to the decoupling of the apparent synchrony between the breeding chronology of  the birds and food availability (Lanctot et al., 2010). Alternatively, climate change could lengthen the growing season, providing flexibility for birds to initiate or replace lost clutches (although this may be more common in Calidrids that do not have a lek mating system), as well as promote survival of chicks – enhancements that could provide an overall positive or neutral effect (Lanctot et al., 2010). During migration, Buff-breasted Sandpipers may be negatively impacted from wind energy installations in the Great Plains/Midwest of the central United States and in coastal portions of the Gulf of Mexico (Lanctot et al., 2010). The short vegetation required by the species is being lost through management of native grasslands for medium to tall vegetation, a reduction in the size of intact grassland units and the conversion of native grasslands or pastures to agriculture and other human development (Lanctot et al., 2010). Agricultural conversion could lead to altered prey availability and increased exposure to pesticides and herbicides. However, little to no quantitative data are available to suggest birds using human-altered habitats have altered migration abilities, lowered survival rates, or affected any other measurable demographic trait. Climate change may also affect the species during migration by increasing the severity of storms over the western Atlantic that could directly impact survival rates of juveniles, which predominately use this pathway during southbound migration (Lanctot et al., 2010).On the non-breeding range, Buff-breasted Sandpipers are threatened by conversion of historic grasslands into agriculture, wood plantations, mines, and tourist locations. Pastures are also being “improved” by ranchers planting exotic vegetation with a different vegetation structure that appears to be less preferred. Such improvements frequently involve applications of fertilizer and other contaminants that may negatively affect the species. Buff-breasted Sandpipers are also vulnerable to changes in ranch management that reduce grazing levels and result in pastures with tall vegetation. Finally, climate change may result in sea-level rise and greater precipitation, which will inundate the many low-lying areas used by the species during the non-breeding season.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,5.7 years

In Schleswig-Holstein,  northern Germany, a decline was observed from 13,000 pairs in 1970 to  1,500 in 1992. A very high decline of 99–100%, followed the improvement  of marginal grasslands in northern England. Low water levels shorten the  period of food availability in pastures, due to the lower penetrability  of soil, and thereby strongly influence the length of breeding season. Changes in habitat structure and food abundance, which already  negatively affect this (and many other) species might also lead to  increased predation risks for nestlings. Careful manipulation of water levels may allow improvement of breeding  success.

This species is also potentially at risk from exposure to DDT's in southern India (Tanabe et al. 1998). Within its European range, the breeding success of this species is not well known, but there are indications that an overall increase of common gulls, crows and mammalian predators has led to increased nest predation. Anthropogenic habitats in the wood processing industry are subject to unpredictable changes that can drive small range populations to extinction within a short period of time.

The population of Red-necked Phalaropes in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, dropped from 2,000,000-3,000,000 birds in the late 1970s to early 1980s to virtual absence by 1989 (Nisbet and Veit 2015). This is thought to have been caused by the effect of 1982/83 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event on the population’s wintering area off Ecuador and Peru, likely due to a change in currents reducing the availability of their plankton prey (Nisbet and Veit 2015). A similar, albeit less extreme, decline was observed in many other Red-necked Phalarope populations both in Europe and the Americas (Nisbet and Veit 2015). This implies the species may be adversely affected by the predicted increase in ENSO events (Timmermann et al. 1999). Habitat destruction, including from peat extraction could also impact the species during its breeding stage. Coastal dredging could also reduce available habitat and prey while at sea (O'Brien et al. 1997).

Lappo in litt. 2012). The area of intertidal wetlands in South Korea has decreased by more  than 50% in the past 25 years, with extensive reclamation at Yeongjong  Island, almost complete reclamation of Asan Bay and inner parts of Namyang Bay,  and complete reclamation of Saemangeum (N. Moores in litt. 2012). Several other sites that support or formerly supported the species in South Korea have been significantly degraded since the 1980s (N. Moores in litt. 2012). The Rudong coast which apparently forms an important staging site is potentially threatened by habitat loss and degradation owing to a large-scale reclamation project (Q. Bai in litt. 2016). The intertidal flats at Rudong and Dongling are threatened by the invasive grass Spartina (Q. Bai in litt. 2016). Pollution in coastal wetlands, hunting and human disturbance are further threats. Observations suggest that hunting is a significant threat at breeding sites in Russia (per E. Lappo in litt. 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,5.7 years

Invasive herbivores pose a threat through denudation of vegetation, with goats likely responsible for its extirpation on Malden Island (Gochfeld et al. 2018). The denudation of Phillip Island by goats, before they died out in the early 1900s, and subsequent prevention of regrowth by rabbits, before their eradication in 1988, is likely to have contributed to their historical decline on this island (Priddel et al. 2010). Increased sea-surface temperatures (SST) have been demonstrated to reduce the provisioning rate at studied colonies along the Great Barrier Reef, and above a particular temperature threshold, reproductive success has been recorded to be zero (Chambers et al. 2011).

Both large spills and ongoing chronic oil pollution are impacting populations of this species (Nikolaeva et al. 2006), and may be contributing to reduced prey abundance and poor adult condition resulting in lowered reproductive output. Certain fisheries may also have contributed to depleted food resources for the species (Frederiksen et al. 2004, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), exacerbating population declines due to increased foraging effort and nutritional stress leading to greater adult mortality or breeding desertion (Paredes et al. 2014). Black-legged Kittiwakes also suffer a level of bycatch in longline fisheries, especially the Spanish Gran Sol longline fishery (BirdLife International 2015), for which there is virtually no monitoring of bycatch and none of the vessels operating in the fishery are currently MSC-certified (E. Dunn in litt. 2018). However, there is virtually no bycatch of kittiwakes in the northern Atlantic, with the species noted to be adept at removing prey without capture at least where the hooks are large (Løkkeborg 1990, Dunn and Steel 2001, E. Dunn in litt. 2018). Avian flu has been recorded in the species, but to date only in very few individuals and without any indication of impacts at the population level (Melville and Shortridge 2006).

Caspian Tern colonies are especially vulnerable to disturbance during the early courtship and incubation stages, during which human visitation results in the flushing of the whole colony, potentially leading to nest or colony abandonment (Cuthbert and Wires 1999 per Shuford and Craig 2002). The effect of disturbance during research activities has been well quantified, with activities such as ringing and cannon-netting representing a large proportion of the reproductive failure in colonies studied (Shuford and Craig 2002). Disturbance due to recreational activities are less well quantified but likely also significant (Shuford and Craig 2002). Much of the loss of reproductive success due to human disturbance occurs through gull predation of chicks during the few seconds of panic flight in which the eggs and chicks of a nest are left exposed (Shuford and Craig 2002). Historically, overexploitation has resulted in large population declines through the collection of eggs and adults for food and feathers (Shuford and Craig 2002). Shooting of birds is still thought to occur, but on a much smaller scale than in the past (Shuford and Craig 2002).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,12.2 years

The Red Fox Vulpes vulpes was noted as the main cause of breeding failure in New South Wales (Australia) in 1995/96 (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2003), and a constant threat at various protected colonies in the UK, such as those in North Wales, where Common Kestrel Falco tinnunculus predation was also considered a factor (Gronant Little Tern Report 2015). The population of Red Fox in the UK has increased in size and range due to changing game-keeping practices, meaning they are likely an increased threat (Tapper 1992). In some parts of the range, birds are also vulnerable to nest predation by the Silver Gull Larus novaehollandiae. The Silver Gull population in New South Wales (Australia) has risen from a few pairs to over 50,000 (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2003). Gulls are also likely to be problematic in other areas, with the culling of predatory gulls in Carleton, Quebec (Canada), key to fledging success (Magella and Brousseau 2001). Little Terns are vulnerable to disturbance from birdwatchers, photographers and the general public, leading to nest failures (Gronant Little Tern Report 2015, BBC 2017). In the UK, 69% of the population breeds on mainland beaches in East Anglia and seems to negatively select for beaches with high disturbance level (Ratcliffe et al. 2008). Expensive interventions and volunteer effort is required to limit anthropogenic disturbance (Ratcliffe et al. 2008, Gronant Little Tern Report 2015).

Natural predators include American Mink Mustela vison, bears Ursus spp. and a variety of bird species. Some chicks may also be killed by Arctic Terns Sterna paradisaea (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2006), however breeding success in the species is lower in the absence of Arctic Terns as they benefit from their aggressive colony defence. Aleutian Terns are very sensitive to disturbance at colonies and may seasonally or even permanently abandon colonies in response to human disturbance (Gochfield et al. 2018). Complete colony abandonment has been observed following a single visit by humans (Haney et al. 1991).Widespread declines across a coastline as large as Alaska’s suggest that declines are not strictly caused by local factors. Shifts in prey distribution due to climate change impacts may be having a particular impact on the species at a large scale. Within a mixed colony, provisioning rates of Arctic Terns were found to be higher than for Aleutian Terns (Gochfield et al. 2018), implying a divergence in preferred prey availability. The cause of this prey limitation may be highly relevant to the declines in the species: it may be that ongoing shifts in the marine habitat have particularly negative consequences for this species.It is also possible that threats that are yet to be determined are acting on the species along its migratory route and in the wintering areas, which are particularly poorly known (M. Rauzon / Pacific Seabird Group in litt. 2017).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,8.53 years

Colonies have declined in line with observed increases in sea temperatures in Australia, in contrast to the fortunes of Bridled Tern, which have formed new colonies further south (Dunlop and Surman 2012). Variations in sea-surface temperature have been shown to negatively influence the species's foraging success at breeding colonies, hence lowering reproductive success (Erwin and Congdon 2007). Previously, persistent large scale egg-collecting in some areas has encouraged the species to move to suboptimal nesting sites, resulting in higher mortality and reduced reproductive success (van Halewyn and Norton 1984).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,11.1 years

Although in most places populations have recovered, hunting remains a significant problem in some areas, including parts of West Africa, where human predation results in a fledging success rate of only 12% (Gochfeld et al. 2018).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,11.5 years

Additionally the following threats have been identified within its European range: increasing tourism and water sports near breeding colonies result in disturbance and the loss of nesting sites (Tucker and Heath 1994) and many nests are lost to adverse weather. It is affected by water quality and so pollution from insecticides and eutrophication are a threat (Martí and Moral 2004); In addition the intensification of fisheries and bycatch in fishing nets are issues (Golemansky 2011). Utilisation Large numbers of eggs are collected for sale and local consumption in India (this may be causing population declines in some areas) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and fishermen collect eggs in Ukraine (del Hoyo et al. 1996).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,9.9 years

The 1997–1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event had a strong effect on breeding success, reducing the number of chicks per pair from more than 1.4 to below 1, mostly caused by desertions before incubation began. Gaston and Smith (2001) found a positive correlation between May sea surface temperature (SST) and the slope of the regression of chick mass at colony departure on a particular date for a given year. Climate change is thought to be driving declines or fluctuations, yet further changes in SST and more frequent ENSO patterns in the future could accentuate the risk to the species. Invasive species are present in parts of the range, exerting negative impacts on local populations through predation. Breeding populations have been declining on both islands where rats Rattus spp. are present; the Lyell Island population declined by 22% over a 10-year period, and the one on Kunghit Island declined by more than 50% over seven years and appeared to be completely extirpated by 2004. Estimates of breeding populations in three rat-free colonies suggest stable or increasing numbers over 18- and 11-year periods (Regehr et al. 2007). The suggestion that racoons Procyon lotor have been responsible for many seabird losses over the last decades is supported by changes in predation levels recorded between years and corresponding seabird population trends. Predation levels were similar in 1990 and 1991, in the presence of raccoons, but declined by 80% in 1992, following the removal of three raccoons. Raccoon predation represents a conservation threat of international significance, because the Queen Charlotte Islands contain the majority of the world's Ancient Murrelet population, as well as substantial populations of several other burrow-nesting species that are also susceptible to raccoon predation (Hartman et al. 1997).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,7.3 years

Egg harvesting at Biro-Jima likely occurred through most of the 20th century until about 1993, but particularly heavy harvesting occurred in 1940–1960s, during and after World War II. The estimated number of eggs harvested in the 1940s to 1960s period was 1,100–2,080 eggs per year. In total, an estimated 47,740– 111,880 eggs were harvested in the 81-year period between 1912 and 1992 (Otsuki 2013). A rough conservative estimate of the number of adults harvested in 1944–1959 is 180–320 adults per year, and 3,056–5,450 adults were estimated to have been killed over a 27-year period between 1944–1970. By about 1970, harvesting of adults appeared to have been discontinued (Otsuki 2013). At present, the species suffers from interaction with commercial fisheries. The estimated total mortality of the species in high-seas drift-net fisheries represents a significant proportion of the total world population (Piatt and Gould 1994). At least 98 Japanese Murrelets were killed in 1990 and between 40-160 individuals may have been killed in 1991. The estimated annual mortality of adults in drift nets (24-250) would equal 1-10.4% of the breeding population. Cessation of gill-net fisheries in international waters in 1992 may have reduced the impact from past levels, but a 320 km Exclusive Economic Zone of Japan still remains operational (Piatt and Gould 1994). The species is known to be vulnerable to predation by rats Rattus spp. (Piatt and Gould 1994, Croxall et al. 2012). In 1987, the remains of 145 individuals were found on Koya Island, where the birds had apparently been killed by rats (Takeishi 1987, Ono 1993). The estimated total mortality was 414 birds. Brown rat Rattus norvegicus has been introduced to some nesting colonies and almost extirpated the population on Koya-Jima, before rats were been eradicated in 1987/1988. However, rats were reintroduced in 2006, and then possibly eradicated for a second time. Landings by fishermen pose a continuing threat of rat reintroduction (M. Sato in litt.). The species is also susceptible to cat Felis catus predation, and is exposed to cats at some colonies. Marado, South Korea, is a popular tourist attraction, and a breeding ground for c.400 Japanese Murrelets, accompanied by c.40 cats. It is believed that cats kill at least 30 birds per annum on Marado (S. Chan pers. comm. 2015). However, the presence of other predators on the island has been confirmed, so mortality might not be caused by cats alone (K. Otsuki pers comm. 2015). Previously, oil spills have occurred within the species's range. The Nakhodka oil spill in 1997 is one of the largest tanker spill accidents on the Japanese coast, releasing almost 6200 kl of oil in the coastal area of Mikuni (Toyoda and Inagaki 2000). The level of regular exposure to oil at sea likely makes the threat ongoing, but only to a minority of the population at a particular time. No rapid population impacts resulting from oil spills have been recorded as yet.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,12.1 years

This also resulted in the elimination of 30-50% of nesting sites along the south shore of Bermuda, as well as making other sites temporarily unusable (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000). This loss of nesting sites is considered to be the most significant long-lasting effect of the hurricanes (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000), although artificial nesting sites, known as ‘Longtail Igloos’, have been successfully installed in many areas of the Bermuda coast. Birds nesting in these artificial nests had greater breeding success than those in natural nests in the 2009 and 2011 breeding seasons (Madeiros 2011).Tropicbirds are vulnerable to oil pollution at sea, with 1 in 4 birds showing oil fouling on arrival to Bermuda in the early 1970s (Wingate 1973 in Butler et al. 1973). Oiled birds failed to breed and disappeared from their nesting sites (Wingate pers. comm.). This threat is decreasing; oil pollution peaked in the Sargasso Sea around 1972 and began to decline as a result of new regulations concerning dumping oil at sea (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000).  Road construction and housing development have impacted tropicbird populations (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000). The construction of sea walls, filling in coastal property, and the carving out of cliffs for development have taken their toll on tropicbird populations. Tropicbirds have mostly been reduced to nesting on inaccessible sea cliffs and remote islands and cays (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000). However, the Bermudan general public are being encouraged to install ‘Longtail Igloos’ on their private property, which may increase the nesting range of the bird (Department of Environment and Natural Resources 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,8.4 years

A small study in the German Baltic found 370 drowned birds over 12 winters (HELCOM 2013). This species also has a strong reaction to disturbance from ships and helicopters, resulting in an altered population distribution and habitat fragmentation.

Kirchhoff in litt. 2010). More recently, however, other approaches to quantify loon harvest have come up with figures of 5 birds annually in 2011 and 2012 (Naves and Zeller 2017). Although this species is vulnerable to oil spills, its very large range means it is unlikely that a large proportion of the global population will be affected by any single event. Mercury or other heavy metal contamination pose a potential threat, particularly for birds wintering on the Asian side of the Pacific where feather and egg mercury concentrations considerably above background levels have been recorded (Evers et al. 2014). There is some competition with fisheries for food, however, this only impacts a small percentage of the global population. Threats are exacerbated by a low reproductive rate and very specific breeding habitat requirements (K.

Rats have invaded at least three of the Japanese breeding islands, with current impacts largely unknown, but likely to affect fledgling success and egg predation (Lee 2010). The shearwaters appear to suffer significant impacts from rats on Mikura-Jima, which is populated by c.300 people and is popular with tourists, thus making an eradication programme problematic and the subsequent reintroduction of rats more likely (Oka et al. 2002, J. Croxall in litt. 2011). Feral cats may also be inflicting increasing mortality on the Mikura-Jima population through predation on chicks, young birds and adults (N. Oka per M. Sato in litt. 2012, S. Uematsu in litt. 2012). Efforts are being taken to capture and neuter feral cats, however due to pressure from the public, cats are hard to eliminate. Currently, climate change is affecting foraging distribution and hence energetic budgets of adults. It is further predicted that whole colonies may be affected in the future as prey populations shift distribution in response to climate change. In addition to these threats, the species is also susceptible to fisheries bycatch (Birds Korea 2010, J. Croxall in litt. 2011), but the impact has not been quantified.  Research suggests the Fukushima nuclear accident may have had negative impacts on birds breeding on Mikura Island, with reduced vitamin A levels detected in chicks following the release of radioactive material (Uematsu et al. 2014). The researchers suggest that additional negative impacts may be expected in the population in the future.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,19.3 years

Between 1952 and 2001, bycatch by North Pacific driftnet fisheries accounted for the mortality of 4,600,000 – 21,200,000 Short-tailed Shearwaters (Uhlmann et al. 2005). Light pollution represents a considerable threat to this species in parts of the range. A number much higher than anticipated, of (predominantly juvenile) shearwaters were found dead or injured as a result of being attracted to lights and grounded. Over a 15-year period of patrols on Phillip Island, Australia (1999-2013), 8,871 fledglings were found grounded, 39% of which were dead or dying. The incidence levels far exceed those of other Shearwater spp. (up to 8x), however less than 1% of fledglings produced annually are thought to be affected by mortality from attraction to artificial light (Rodriguez et al. 2014).  Wreck (mass-mortality events) have been reported, e.g. at Bering Sea 1997 (Hyrenbach et al. 2001) and in Australia 2013 (Peter and Dooley 2014) and are potentially linked to ecosystem changes caused by climate change (Brooke 2004). Recent studies indicate that both young and adults suffer from the ingestion of marine plastic debris, with potentially lethal effects (Carey 2011).

Feral cats are considered a major driver of the present distribution of the species, for example on the Azores where breeding areas are restricted to steep cliffs wherever cats are present and local extinctions may have been caused by cat predation in the past. House Rats are present on many of the islands on which the species breeds or would be likely to breed, and, along with cats, is thought to be one of the main determinants of the current breeding distribution. In one colony on Madeira predation of Shearwater chicks by Madeiran Wall Lizards Teira dugessii has been recorded in up to 10% of nests, however no overall impact on colony breeding success has been found and lizard predation is highly unlikely to have an impact on the species on a population level (Matias et al. 2009).  The large colony in Desertas Island, Madeira suffers intense human exploitation for food or fish bait, which also occurs at a lower level in other North East Atlantic sites, although not in the Salvage Islands, Madeira following the declaration of the islands as a national park (Carboneras et al. 2014). The species may be at risk of incidental capture in longline fisheries, but as yet, no significant effects of bycatch on adult mortality have been documented (Waugh et al. 2012). Due to the species’ foraging habit and wide range overlapping with many commercial fishing lanes, it is thought to suffer a heightened risk of mortality from oil spills and other marine pollution. Light pollution at night might be an important cause of mortality in some areas, and tourism and recreational developments may reduce available habitat in breeding colonies on the Canary Islands, Madeira and Azores (Carboneras et al. 2014).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,23.9 years

The area of suitable habitat available for breeding is being reduced in Russia and Eastern Europe through deforestation (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (particularly the destruction of large traditional nesting trees) (Hancock et al. 1992, Lohmus and Sellis 2003), the rapid development of industry and farming (Hancock et al. 1992), the building of dams (Diagana et al. 2006) and lake drainage for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian et al. 2002). The species's wetland wintering habitats in Africa are further threatened by conversion (del Hoyo et al. 1992), agricultural intensification, desertification and pollution caused by the concentration of pesticides and other chemicals (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Diagana et al. 2006). The species is also occasionally killed by collisions with power-lines and overhead cables (Hockey et al. 2005), and hunting in southern Europe and tropical Asia (especially during migration) have caused population declines (Hancock et al. 1992).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,15.9 years

In Russia, spring fires threaten breeding sites and kill nest trees. Reclamation of wetlands, particularly in the Yangtze basin, has reduced the area of habitat for wintering birds and caused disturbance. Overfishing is a problem at many breeding and wintering sites in China. A satellite-tracking study indicated very high juvenile mortality on passage and in winter (Van den Bossche et al. 2001). Wintering birds move large distances between sites (Van den Bossche et al. 2001). Birds are hunted and collected for zoos, in Russia and China, despite legal protection. Dams on the Amur River and the forthcoming Three Gorges Dam in China are likely to have detrimental impacts upon the species, although they may affect this species less severely than others as they feed on fish and are therefore less susceptible to changes in water levels (M. Barter in litt. 2006, S. Chan in litt. 2006). More than 30 storks were found poisoned at Beidagang Reservoir in 2012, likely victims of poaching of geese and ducks (Simba in litt. 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,16.1 years

It also suffers from accidental entanglement in fishing gear associated with the intense fishing pressure in South-East Asian waters causing slow but significant population declines (Burung Laut Indonesia 2013, Hennicke 2014, Tirtaningtyas and Hennicke 2015). Overfishing of large predatory fish that drive frigatebird prey to the surface has the potential to cause food shortages (Commonwealth of Australia 2020). Marine pollution represents another significant threat to the population (James 2006, Noni 2012). Included in the species’ range are inshore waters with high levels of contamination from heavy metals and a variety of other industrial pollutants, but the impacts of pollution on the species are currently unknown (Tirtaningtyas and Yordan 2017). Waste disposal and pollution produced by several activities (e.g. industry, recreation and sport) are potential threats, as recorded in the important foraging grounds of Jakarta Bay (Arifin 2004). Historically, clearance of forest and dust pollution from phosphate mining and other development may have reduced the population on Christmas Island or forced birds to nest in other areas (Stokes 1988, James 2003, James and McAllan 2014), but at the time of writing no clearing of the island's old-growth forest (primary vegetation) has been permitted since 1988. Currently, land-based threats are unlikely to be causing population declines: although weeds could affect some breeding areas in the long term if not controlled, and burning off on the golf course, ingestion of plastic (Commonwealth of Australia 2020) and infection with Hemosporidian blood parasites (Quillfeldt et al. 2010, Merino et al. 2012) may affect some individuals, they have not been linked to declines. Extreme weather, habitat shifts and ecosystem degradation associated with climate change poses an ongoing and future threat to the species. Demonstrated effects of increased sea surface temperatures and decreased marine productivity on the foraging of Abbott’s Boobies around Christmas Island (Hennicke and Weimerskirch 2014), suggest that the impacts of climate change are already affecting the seabird food chain in the Christmas Island Frigatebird’s breeding range. Threats currently considered negligible include drowning in artificial water bodies and heavy metal contamination (Commonwealth of Australia 2020), that the productivity of marine systems in the region may decline as a result of climate change (Bryndum‐Buchholz et al. 2019) potentially depleting tuna populations (Dueri 2017), and the threat posed by vines smothering one of the few roost sites available on the roost island in Jakarta Bay, Indonesia (F. Tirtaningtyas pers. comm.).Another possible threat is the invasive yellow crazy ant Anoplolepis gracilipes, which formed super-colonies during the 1990s and spread rapidly to cover about 25% (3,400 ha) of Christmas Island. Control measures have so far been unable to eradicate this non-native species, but to date Frigatebirds do not appear to have been adversely affected (Hennicke 2014). However, ant super-colonies alter island ecology by killing the dominant life-form, the red crab Gecaroidea natalis, and by farming scale insects which damage the trees. This may alter the breeding habitat of the species in the medium- to long-term (J. Hennicke in litt. 2010). Currently, there are only four significant nesting colonies of Christmas Island Frigatebirds (James and McAllan 2014). Considerable areas of former breeding habitat have already been cleared and the species was likely more numerous prior to this loss of habitat (Hill and Dunn 2004). The low number, limited extent and reduced size of breeding areas render the species highly susceptible to stochastic events and vulnerable to further habitat loss, either through resumed mining operations, other sources of pollution or climate change.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,18.4 years

Humans also indirectly affect the species; Verlis et al. (2014) found that most S. leucogaster nests surveyed contain at least one item of marine debris, with black and green items positively selected for as a nesting material. Further to this, Lavers et al. (2013) found that around 30% of the debris poses some entanglement risk to the birds. This is currently unlikely to represent a significant source of injury and mortality (Lavers et al. 2013), but is likely to increase due to the long term persistence of marine debris. In the past, organochemical pollution has caused a significant reduction  in reproductive success due to the thinning of eggshells, often caused by DDT use in agricultural areas as well as, in one case, mosquito control  for a tourist development. Currently, eggshell thickness varies in  relation to individual characteristics and/or feeding sources, as  opposed to actual exposure and, where records are available, eggshell  thickness has recovered to pre-DDT conditions (Mellink et al. 2009).

Increasing levels of disturbance by fishers and tourists and also hunting are threats in China and Vietnam (Wei Guoan et al. 2005). Fishers in China collect waterbird eggs at nesting sites.

In the same period, summer visiting birds in Japan had decreased, although resident species were stable or had increased (Higuchi and Morishita 1999). Habitat destruction in the wintering areas is now considered as the main cause of population reduction. However, loss of forest floor vegetation and the subsequent loss of soil due to Sika Deer Cervus nippon may also affect viability of breeding populations in Japanese forests (S. Hayama in litt. 2020). Small-scale housing developments, solar power generation, cemetery development, and a general reduction in incentive to maintain biodiversity may also be negatively impacting some breeding sites (Wild Bird Society of Japan [Tokyo] in litt. 2020). The development of dense scrub undergrowth in forest and on abandoned farmland (following a change in traditional agricultural practices) is also believed to reduce the suitability of these habitats for feeding. It has probably been hunted in many parts of its range (including passage sites in northern Philippines and across its wintering area on Mindanao where it gets caught in snares; P. Simpson in litt. 2020, D. Allen in litt. 2020), and suffers from human disturbance (Anon. 2009). It declined rapidly on Miyake-jima in the Izu Islands, where it was formerly abundant, following the introduction of Siberian Weasel Mustela sibirica in the early 1970s.

Although killing at aquaculture farms has not reduced the global population so far (possibly because it is young birds that are mostly killed), 800 individuals are estimated to have died per year at Scottish fish-farms between 1984 and 1987 by being shot, drowned or poisoned by fish farmers (Carss 1994, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Renewed hunting poses a threat to populations in Bavaria (Germany) by decreasing numbers to levels that inhibit recovery following severe winters (severe winters increase mortality rates for juveniles) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is vulnerable in Madagascar owing to its restricted range, exceedingly high levels of habitat alteration (from siltation and the need for agricultural land for rice and grazing), hunting, and predation at nesting colonies (Kushlan and Hafner 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Timber harvesting is a threat throughout much of the species's range by removing trees used by nesting colonies and/or disturbing nearby colonies (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

A combination of deforestation and the collection of eggs and live birds drove the species extinct in Azerbaijan (del Hoyo et al. 1994). In the U.S.A. (and to a lesser extent elsewhere), numbers fell significantly from 1950-1970 as a result of pesticide use, although they are now recovering, as they are in Scotland where the species had been extirpated by collection and hunting (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Pesticide use has now been reduced to a minor, and largely historical, threat. However shooting still affects many birds on migration in the Mediterranean (Monti et al. 2018b), as well as wintering birds in tropical regions including Latin America and the West Indies (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). A few Australian birds are apparently impacted by local human disturbance (del Hoyo et al. 1994).It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Since 1979, the effect of human activity on osprey mortality has fallen (De Pascalis et al. 2020), though birds are still at risk of deliberate shooting and entanglement in fish nets (ibid, see also Monti et al. 2018b). Though there is no direct evidence for its effect on osprey populations, intensive trawler fishing is likely to deplete fish stocks and affect prey availability. Other fishing practices are also likely damaging; copper sulphate fishing may lead to poisoning and motor boats may disturb osprey nests (Monti et al. 2013).

The main cause of unnatural death is the use of poisoned baits for predator extermination (Anon. 2004b), although shooting and destruction of nests also occurs (Anon. 2004b; N. Batbayar in litt. 2005), and they may accidentally get caught in traps set for other predators (Zhatkanbaev 2011). Shooting and poisoning are increasing in Mongolia (N. Batbayar in litt. 2005), and many birds are trapped or shot in China for their feathers. There are fears that veterinary application of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, which has caused the near-extinction of several Gyps vultures in India, may have a negative impact on A. monachus (N. Batbayar in litt. 2005; Inskipp et al. 2016), particularly as increasing numbers of the species are wintering in northern India (T. Katzner in litt. 2005). The recent approval for commercialisation of veterinary diclofenac in Spain may have devastating effects on European vultures - in 2020 a Cinereous Vulture was confirmed as the first individual to die from veterinary diclofenac in Europe (BirdLife 2021). A study in central Spain during 2003-2005 found high concentrations of antibiotics in blood samples from 57% of nestlings tested (Lemus et al. 2008). The same study found two antibiotics in the liver samples of all dead nestlings that were tested. It is hypothesised that antibiotic residues, particularly quinolones, cause liver and kidney damage, deplete lymphoid organs and alter bacteria flora, facilitating pathogenic bacterial and fungal infections (Lemus et al. 2008). The anti-inflammatory drug nimesulide, suspected to be highly toxic is also considered to be present widely across Nepal (C. Bowden in litt. 2018). In Europe, decreased food availability was formerly caused by European Union legislation on carcass disposal (Anon. 2004b), however, recently passed regulations will allow the operation of feeding stations for scavengers (A. Brunner in litt. 2010). In eastern Europe and central Asia, particularly in the former Soviet Union, changes in agricultural practices and human migration from the countryside to the cities have greatly reduced numbers of domestic livestock. In Georgia and Armenia, declines may be linked to the loss of subsidies for sheep-herding in the post-Soviet era (M. McGrady in litt. 2007). Additionally, there have been steep declines in many populations of wild ungulates which provide a major food source for the species. The Saiga antelope (Saiga tartarica), for example, numbered over one million individuals ten years ago, and has now been reduced to a population of 30,000-40,000 owing to uncontrolled hunting and severe winters (W. Fremuth in litt. 2005). In South Korea, food limitation is a serious problem such that the species relies on supplementary food (Lee et al. 2006). Habitat loss is also thought to be important (Anon. 2004). For instance, in Portugal, there may be suitable foraging areas, but nesting sites are limited (Lourenço et al. 2013). The majority of brood losses occur during the incubation period and it is suspected this may be partially due to low and fluctuating temperatures (Batbayar et al. 2006) and so changes in air temperatures resulting from climate change may be a potential future threat to the species. Nest abandonment can also occur as a result of disturbance, for instance cork exploitation (Margalida et al. 2011). Recent studies surrounding the core population of Cinereous Vultures in the Balkans (thought to be genetically distinctive and geographically isolated) also found wind farms to be a potential threat towards the species (Vasilakis et al. 2016). Where operational wind farms existed, collision mortality was thought to affect c. 5-11% of the core population (Vasilakis et al. 2016). Low mitochondrial diversity and demographic bottlenecks were also found in Turkish populations, likely preventing population expansion (Çakmak et al. 2019a, b). The exact effect genetic vulnerability however requires further investigation. Due to proximity to urban areas, electric shocks and collision can further impact migratory birds, especially across the species's migration route to China (Ming 2019).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,13.9 years

The deforestation is caused by agriculture (Phumee et al. 2017), infrastructure development, and the harvesting of forest products (Chaudhary et al. 2016). In Japan there is one record of the species contracting avian influenza virus (H5N1) (Shivakoti et al. 2010). In Taiwan, the species is increasingly hunted for its feathers (Taiban et al. 2019), and it is exploited for the pet trade in some parts of Southeast Asia (Morris 1994). There is evidence from Nepal of this species being persecuted due to it taking poultry as prey (T. R. Subedi, S. Gurung, H. S. Baral, S. Thomsett, R. Buij and M. Virani in litt. 2021). Furthermore, it is also threatened by electrocution from powerlines, particularly in Nepal where ambitious hydro-electricity plans are leading to the creation of a large power network (T. R.
